# IVIF-CODAS Methods
This repository contains MATLAB source code necessary to reproduce the results presented in the following paper:

"A Modified Interval Valued Intuitionistic Fuzzy CODAS Method and Its Application to Multi-Criteria Selection Among Renewable Energy Alternatives in Turkey"

By Kaan Deveci, Rabia Cin, and Ahmet Kağızman.

Accepted for publication in Applied Soft Computing.

The method shown in this repository can be used to compare the existing interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy (IVIF) COmperative Distance based ASsessment (CODAS) methods in the literature and can be used to reproduce the results in the given research paper. 

This is our first open source code publication, and we would like to apologize for any possible code implementation problems you may encounter. Should you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to write an email to: devecik@itu.edu.tr
